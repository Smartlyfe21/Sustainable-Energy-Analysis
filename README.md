# Sustainable Energy and Environmental Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption, environmental impact, and electricity access across different countries and regions. By leveraging machine learning models and data analysis techniques, i will aim at identifying opportunities for improving energy efficiency, reducing environmental impacts, and enhancing electricity access. The insights gained can inform better policy decisions and promote sustainable practices globally.

## Key Analyses

### 1. Energy Consumption Analysis
- Examines energy consumption patterns based on:
  - Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking
  - Access to electricity
  - Renewable energy consumption
- Helps identify areas for energy efficiency improvements and enhanced renewable energy adoption.

### 2. Environmental Impact Analysis
- Evaluates the environmental footprint of different countries by analyzing:
  - CO2 emissions
  - CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption
  - Total greenhouse gas emissions
- Aims to highlight areas where environmental policies need reinforcement and sustainable practices can be implemented.

### 3. Electricity Access Analysis
- Assesses electricity access patterns based on:
  - Rural and urban electricity access rates
  - Time required to get electricity (in days)
- Helps identify regions where electricity infrastructure requires development and where renewable energy investments can be increased.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Git & GitHub

## Project Highlights
